A 560x500x32mm slab of kitchen counter top were left over when the hole for the sink was cut. These are my project files for making a cutting board from that piece.

The stock is pretty flat, so I am hoping much planing won't be needed. Aiming for 30mm final thickness.

I took an embarrassingly long time to make these files as I have no prior experience in 3D modeling or woodworking. I used FreeCAD to make the project and export in relevant formats, but I'm not sure if these files are adequate for a CNC project. Or if a CNC machine is even the way to most easily make this.
